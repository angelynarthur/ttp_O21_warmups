-- YET ANOTHER CASE WHEN PROBLEM :D

-- Return the titles and descriptions of all films, with a new column "Holiday",
-- that contains the holiday referenced in the film, if any, otherwise is blank.
-- all holiday's welcome :) 

-- EXAMPLE: 
-- title: "Fiction Christmas" -> 'Christmas'
-- description: "The story of a chritmas elf who ...." --> 'Christmas'
-- "Something About Mary" --> ""

-- BONUS: return all of the holiday films first, and sort all films with their 
-- respective holiday category in alphabetical order.

-- BONUS BONUS:
-- Our marketing team is doing a holiday promo. All holiday films 1/2.
-- Can you return the same results, but with the price reflecting the discount?

-- Feel free to peek at your previous warmup to remind yourself of the syntax.


SELECT title, description, rental_rate,
CASE WHEN title ILIKE '%christmas%' or title ILIKE '%halloween%' THEN title
ELSE ' ' END AS Holiday
